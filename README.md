<h1> ParaEMT </h1>
<h2> NREL's EMT simulator: An Open Source, Parallelizable, and HPC-Compatible Large-Scale Power System Electro-Magnetic Transient (EMT) Simulator </h2>

Welcome to the ParaEMT simulation package! This open-source tool aims to provide a powerful and flexible platform for simulating electromagnetic transients (EMT) of large-scale inverter-based resource (IBR)-dominated power systems. The purpose of making it open source is to foster a community of EMT simulation and assist in exploring new EMT algorithms and applying advanced computational techniques to EMT simulation.

<h1> Feature </h1>

* EMT modeling 
* EMT Network equation: nodal formulation based on Trapezoidal-rule method
* EMT network parallel solver: BBD
* Parallel computation of updateing device states and network historical current
* Compatible with HPC
* Compatible with dynamic-link library (DLL) supported dynamic models
* Compiled with the just-in-time (JIT) compiler, Numba, in Python
* Results down-sampling
* Save simulation progress as a snapshot file, and resume the simulation from a saved snapshot
* Test systems library: the Kundur two-area system, IEEE 9-bus system, IEEE 39-bus system, Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) 179-bus system, and WECC 240-bus system
* Fully open source and transparent: Allows unrestricted access to the underlying source code and encourages active engagement and contributions from the community

<h1> Note </h1>

* For cunducting simulations on large systems, we recommend using the snapshot functionality to save a stable steady state, and then conduct different contigency simulations from the snapshot
* To reduce the required computer memory for storing simulation results on large systems, we recomment using a larger down-smapling rate, e.g., DSrate=50
* Currently, we have built a lot of new functions, including Python code for results plotting, bus/line fault simulation, forced oscillation simulation, a license-free power flow solver using Python package ANDES, interface with DLL models, and son on. A new version that contains more functions will be released in the near future
* A user manual webpage of ParaEMT is under development and will be released in the near future

<h1> System component library </h1>

<h1> Getting Started with ParaEMT </h1>

* To conduct EMT simulations using PataEMT, follow these steps:

<img src="https://github.com/NREL/ParaEMT_public/assets/102193041/72beb4a9-4aac-475b-a0ab-980435a339b0" width="800">

<h1> Structure of ParaEMT </h1>

* Main Functions and Subfunction Libraries 

  The first function, main_step0_CreateLargeCases, serves the dual purpose of executing and storing the power flow solution and, optionally, generating synthetic large-scale systems. The second function, main_step1_sim, is responsible for initializing and simulating the system dynamics. The third function, main_step2_save, saves the simulation results.

* Simulation Initialization
