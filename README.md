<h2> NREL's EMT simulator: An Open Source, Parallelizable, and HPC-Compatible Large-Scale Power System Electro-Magnetic Transient (EMT) Simulator </h2>

Welcome to the ParaEMT simulation package! This open-source tool aims to provide a powerful and flexible platform for simulating electromagnetic transients (EMT) of large-scale inverter-based resource (IBR)-dominated power systems. The purpose of making it open source is to foster a community of EMT simulation and assist in exploring new EMT algorithms and applying advanced computational techniques to EMT simulation.

<h1> Feature </h1>

* EMT modeling
* EMT Network equation: nodal formulation based on Trapezoidal-rule method
* EMT network parallel solver: BBD
* Parallel computation of updateing device states and network historical current
* Compatible with HPC

<h1> Version Advisory </h1>

* Work with Pyhton v3.7+.
